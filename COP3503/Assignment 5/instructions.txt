In this assignment, you will extend the java code that you have written for assignment 2. Make sure that you create a new Repl.it project and Java class file for this assignment. Submit the .java file only.

Your file should be named “Main.java”.

Instructions

    Ask the user how many year inputs he wants to check - an integer.
        Assume that the user always gives an input which is between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
    Next, ask the user for K number of year inputs where K = the number user has given as input before (inside a while loop).
    Check for each year input whether that year is a leap year or not (Assignment 2).
        Take year input (positive integer - should be between 1500 and 2017, inclusive).
        If the year input is not between 1500 and 2017, do not check for leap year, rather print that this year cannot be checked.
        If the input year is a leap year, print that year is a leap year; otherwise, print that the year is not a leap year.
        make sure to handle the centurial years, i.e., years ending in 00, e.g., 1900, 1800, 1700, 2000, etc.?
    Copy the code written for Assignment 2 and add the 'while loop' on top of that. Use while loop only for this assignment. 

 
Goals

    Gain experience in input taking using the scanner class in Java.
    Gain experience in if/else selection statement in Java.
    Gain experience in while loop techniques in Java.

 
Sample Code Structure

// add necessary import commands

public class samplecode{

   public static void main (String[] args){

      // create the required variables first.

     while (not all inputs have been taken - add this condition here){

        //add the code from assignment 2.

      }

   }

}

 
Test Your Program

    Once the code is typed, you will compile+run (execute) your code.
    You will input the number of years (integer input).
    Next input the actual year values between 1500 and 2017  (integer input).
    See the output given by your code.

 
Sample Output

Your output should look like this:

    How many years do you want to check (must be between 1 and 5)? 2
    What's the year you want to test? (make sure it's between 1500 and 2017): 1400
    This year cannot be checked. Try again!
    What's the year you want to test? (make sure it's between 1500 and 2017): 2016
    Yes, 2016 is a leap year!

    How many years do you want to check (must be between 1 and 5)? 3
    What's the year you want to test? (make sure it's between 1500 and 2017): 1400
    This year cannot be checked. Try again!
    What's the year you want to test? (make sure it's between 1500 and 2017): 2016
    Yes, 2016 is a leap year!
    What's the year you want to test? (make sure it's between 1500 and 2017): 2017
    Nope, 2017 is not a leap year!
